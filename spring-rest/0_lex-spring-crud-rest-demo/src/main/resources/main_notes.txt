SPRING REST API
1. import required dependencies:
-spring-boot-starter-web
-spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
-mysql-connector-java
-(optional) spring-boot-devtools : auto-refreshes the server

2. create the persistence, service & rest controller layers
-(optional layers) advise/utility & exception

3. in rest controller, make sure to:
annotate with @CrossOrigin to enable API clients to request resources
annotate with @RestController, @RequestMapping(value = "/xxx") at the class level
and @xxxMapping at method levels
-xxx = get, post, put, patch, delete

4. for rest layer methods return a ResponseEntity<>(x1,x2) which x1 will handle the data response obj, and x2 http status codes

5. the rest controller api layer must communicate with the service layer

6. the service layer must communicate with the persistence layer. 
annotate it with @Transactional

6. (optional) in the main application class, you'll see a demo on how to consume rest apis using rest template (which is an almost deprecated approach)

note: 
com.thomas.springdatarest.api is the controller layer package of this project
